# __TM ROS Driver__

This driver is for ROS2 Dashing version.

If you want to use Foxy version, please go to our [Foxy version driver](https://github.com/TechmanRobotInc/tmr_ros2).

If you want to know how to use this driver, please go to our [TM ROS1 driver](https://github.com/TechmanRobotInc/tmr_ros1)


## __Demo Code__
There are some demoe codes to show how to use this driver.

> 1. demo_send_script:<br/>
In this demo code, it shows how to send a listen node script to control the robot. <br/>
You can use service named "send_script" to send script.<br/>
"id"->The transaction number expressed in any alphanumeric characters . (Reports the CPERR 04 error if a non-alphanumeric byte is encountered .  When used as a communication packet response , it is a transaction number and identifies which group of commands to respond.<br/>
"script"-> the script which you want to send.<br/>
"ok" -> Correctness of the script.
> 2. demo_ask_item:<br/>
In this demo code, you can send TMSCT cmd by using this service. More details please refer to the TM_Robot_Expression.pdf(version 1.76_6300) Chapter 7.4 TMSCT<br/>
> 3. demo_ask_sta:<br/>
In this demo code, you can send TMSTA cmd by using this service. Please refer to the TM_Robot_Expression.pdf(1.76_6300) 7.5 TMSTA to get more detail<br/>
> 4. demo_connect_tm:<br/>
In this demo code, you can set connection. <br/>
If you set to reconnect as true, every time when driver disconnects from listen node, it will try to re-connect it.<br/>
There are two topics you can use, one is "connect_tmsvr" which is setting ethercad server connection, and the other is "connect_tmsct" which is setting TM-Flow connection.<br/>
> 5. demo_set_event:<br/>
In this demo code, there are six types of events you can use.<br/> 
func: You can use TAG, WAIT_TAG, STOP, PAUSE, RESUME and EXIT<br/>
arg0: if fun is TAG or WAIT_TAG, arg0 is timeout in ms<br/>
arg1: if fun is TAG or WAIT_TAG, arg1 is id<br/>
> 6. demo_set_io:<br/>
In this demo code, you should set module, type, pin and state. The detail you can read the TM_Robot_Expression.pdf(1.76.6300) Chapter 6.5 IO<br/>
module : MODULE_CONTROLBOX or MODULE_ENDEFFECTOR<br/>
type: TYPE_DIGITAL_IN, TYPE_DIGITAL_OUT, TYPE_INSTANT_DO, TYPE_ANALOG_IN, TYPE_ANALOG_OUT, TYPE_INSTANT_AO<br/>
pin: pin number<br/>
state: STATE_OFF or STATE_ON or other value(if digitial IO)<br/>
> 7. demo_set_positions:<br/>
In this demo, you should be careful all units are not degree, they are rad.<br/>
motion_type : PTP_J , PTP_T , LINE_J , LINE_T , CIRC_J ,CIRC_T , PLINE_J ,PLINE_T.  More details please refer to the TM_Robot_Expression.pdf Chapter 9.6-9.9<br/>
positions : target position or target joint(rad)<br/>
velocity : joint velocity-> max value is Pi -> 3.14 rad/s , line velocity ->m/s <br/>
acc_time : to max speed time in millisecond<br/>
blend_percentage : this cannot become 0
fine_goal : if false, when it return in position, but not real in position, you should wait few ms<br/>
> 8. demo_write_item: <br/>
In this demo code, you can send TMSVR cmd by using this service. More details please refer to the TM_Robot_Expression.pdf Chapter(1.76.6300) 9.3 svr_write
> 9. demo_leave_listen_node:<br/>
In this demo code, you can use send_script service sending a script to leave the listen node.
## How to use demo code & driver
1. Creat a folder ``~/tm_driver`` by type<br/>
``mkdir ~/tm_driver``<br/>
``cd ~/tm_driver``
2. Download this package by using git and change into dashing branch<br/>
``git clone https://github.com/TechmanRobotInc/tmr_ros2.git``<br/>
``git checkout dashing-devel``<br/>
3. Build the source code and set the path<br/>
``colcon build``<br/>
``source ./install/setup.bash``<br/>
4. Open a terminal and type<br/>
``ros2 run tm_driver tm_driver <robot_ip>``<br/>
<robot_ip> is tm robot ip address, you can get it by TM Flow, for example 192.168.10.2
5. Open another terminal and type which demo you want to try. 
For example you want to try demo_set_io, you can type<br/>
``ros2 run demo demo_set_io``<br/>
:warning: Some demos will let the robot move, please be careful.

## GUI debug and demo
This GUI shows up tm_driver connection status, sct sta svr messages and robot status. You can use this GUI to check driver and robot connect status and send re-connect command and base on this GUI to modify.

### Hoe to use it
1. Creat a folder ``~/tm_driver`` by type<br/>
``mkdir ~/tm_driver``<br/>
``cd ~/tm_driver``
2. Download this package by using git and change into dashing branch<br/>
``git clone https://github.com/TechmanRobotInc/tmr_ros2.git``<br/>
``git checkout dashing-devel``<br/>
3. Build the source code and set the path<br/>
``colcon build``<br/>
``source ./install/setup.bash``<br/>
4. Open a terminal and type<br/>
``ros2 run tm_driver tm_driver <robot_ip>``<br/>
<robot_ip> is tm robot ip address, you can get it by TM Flow, for example 192.168.10.2
5. Open another terminal and type<br/>
``ros2 run ui_for_debug_and_demo robot_ui``<br/>

### UI description
1. When ``is_srv_connect`` and ``is_sct_connect`` are true, it means the all connection is success.
2. If ``is_srv_connect`` is false, you should check the data table is correct or not.
3. If ``is_sct_connect`` is false, you should check whether you run the project or not.
4. If ``is_srv_connect`` and ``is_sct_connect`` are true, but ``robot link`` is false. It means you connect the TM project, but you are not in listen node, so you when you send the move command, it doesn't work.
5. When you send a command or click ``"change control box IO"``, you can see ``"Robot Response"`` add a response item, the item details you can reference ``SctResponse.msg``, ``StaResponse.msg`` and ``SvrResponse.msg``.
6. You can click ``"clear"`` to clear the old response items.
7. If you didn't open the ``tm_ros_driver``, you will see all items show ``"Not ini"``.
